       "\"Certainly! A **large language model** (LLM) is an advanced type of artificial intelligence (AI) model specifically designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet, books, websites, and other sources, allowing them to learn patterns, structures, and nuances in language.\\n\\nHere are some key characteristics of LLMs:\\n\\n1. **Size and Complexity**: Large language models typically consist of billions or even hundreds of billions of parameters, which enable them to capture intricate relationships between words and phrases.\\n\\n2. **Contextual Understanding**: They can understand the context of a sentence or passage and generate responses that are coherent and relevant.\\n\\n3. **Multitasking**: LLMs are capable of performing various language-related tasks, such as translation, summarization, question answering, and more, without needing task-specific training.\\n\\n4. **Generalization**: Due to their extensive training on diverse datasets, LLMs can generalize well to new types of text they haven't seen before.\\n\\n5. **Iterative Improvement**: As more data becomes available, LLMs can be fine-tuned or retrained to improve their performance on specific tasks.\\n\\nExamples of popular large language models include **GPT-3** (developed by OpenAI), **PaLM** (by Google), and **Qwen** (developed by Alibaba Cloud). These models have been instrumental in advancing natural language processing and AI applications across various industries.\""

      "NAME reported struggling with what she described as health/death anxiety, which is being exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. She stated that she has always had worries about family members/friends becoming ill or dying but that these worries are now worse and are causing her difficulties. It is worse at night when she becomes convinced that something bad will happen to her friends or family. NAME described some ‘compulsive checking’ in order to have a sense of control (e.g. she will check marks on her body).\n",
      "\n",
      "NAME reported a diagnosis of GAD, which she received after seeing a private psychiatrist shortly before doing her A Levels. She was prescribed medications (see below), which she finds beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current impact:\n",
      "Poor/interrupted sleep, has to listen to podcasts as she doesn’t want to listen to her own thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impact on studies:\n",
      "Because of the above, NAME oversleeps because she doesn’t hear her alarms and misses lectures/seminars. She is therefore having to do more work as she is constantly catching up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Support from Personal Tutor:\n",

      "NAME grew up in the South of England. Her parents divorced when she was one after which she moved to the countryside with her mum. Her mum remarried and had a son – NAME stated being very close to her half-brother who is 10 years younger.\n",
      "\n",
      "NAME reported a challenging relationship with her father. She learned later in life that he had not contributed financially to NAME’s upbringing and that he had had an affair, which is why her parents separated. She is in contact with her father but described him as being focussed on himself. He married the woman he had an affair with and they have a son aged 16. NAME noted that she has a fear of ‘being left’ that she links to her relationship with her father. This fear can manifest in her relationships, e.g. with her boyfriend.\n",
      "\n",
      "NAME went to a girls’ boarding school from the age of 13 to 18. She had been ‘terrified’ in her previous school which was a mixed comprehensive. At boarding school she had to make friends and so she felt more comfortable there.\n",
      "\n",
      "NAME described her mother as ‘neurotic’ and having some ‘OCD traits’ – she feels compelled to clean all the floors and bathrooms of the house and has to do certain cleaning jobs on certain days. She gets in a bad mood if she can’t do them in this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social situation and support networks:\n",
      "NAME lives in a flat with two other girls she didn’t know before but they are ‘both lovely’ and she is happy there.\n",
      "NAME has been with her boyfriend for 2.5 years. They met at Uni.\n",
      "Other friends who were housemates in first and second year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are support networks aware of issues?\n",
      "Yes – ‘everyone’. NAME said that she is open about her issues because she doesn’t want to offend people with her behaviour (e.g. when she needs to leave an event).\n",

      "Work with other health professionals:\n",
      "None currently.\n",

      "Current and past healthy and unhealthy coping strategies:\n",
      "Pushing herself through to do things that she isn’t comfortable with\n",
      "Having things organised for the following day – NAME described feeling overwhelmed if she doesn’t know what is coming during the day or if things change so she tries to be as prepared as possible.\n",
      "Sleeps in a lot as it’s the only time she ‘can be still or calm’\n",
      "Tries to have a ‘safe person’ with her (family member, friend, boyfriend) so she doesn’t feel judged.\n",

      "Presenting Problem:\n",
      "Oli reported struggling with what she described as health/death anxiety, which is being exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. She stated that she has always had worries about family members/friends becoming ill or dying but that these worries are now worse and are causing her difficulties. It is worse at night when she becomes convinced that something bad will happen to her friends or family. Oli described some ‘compulsive checking’ in order to have a sense of control (e.g. she will check marks on her body).\n",
      "\n",
      "Oli reported a diagnosis of GAD, which she received after seeing a private psychiatrist shortly before doing her A Levels. She was prescribed medications (see below), which she finds beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current impact:\n",
      "Poor/interrupted sleep, has to listen to podcasts as she doesn’t want to listen to her own thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impact on studies:\n",
      "Because of the above, Oli oversleeps because she doesn’t hear her alarms and misses lectures/seminars. She is therefore having to do more work as she is constantly catching up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Support from Personal Tutor:\n",
      "None as yet. Oli feels embarrassed to tell them about her issues. We discussed this and she will consider telling them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "Oli grew up in the South of England. Her parents divorced when she was one after which she moved to the countryside with her mum. Her mum remarried and had a son – Oli stated being very close to her half-brother who is 10 years younger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oli reported a challenging relationship with her father. She learned later in life that he had not contributed financially to Oli’s upbringing and that he had had an affair, which is why her parents separated. She is in contact with her father but described him as being focussed on himself. He married the woman he had an affair with and they have a son aged 16. Oli noted that she has a fear of ‘being left’ that she links to her relationship with her father. This fear can manifest in her relationships, e.g. with her boyfriend.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Oli described her mother as ‘neurotic’ and having some ‘OCD traits’ – she feels compelled to clean all the floors and bathrooms of the house and has to do certain cleaning jobs on certain days. She gets in a bad mood if she can’t do them in this way.\n",

      "\n",
      "Are support networks aware of issues?\n",
      "Yes – ‘everyone’. Oli said that she is open about her issues because she doesn’t want to offend people with her behaviour (e.g. when she needs to leave an event).\n",

      "NAME described a long term history of anxiety and low mood. She often worries about things outside of her control or future things, finding she blows things out of proportion. NAME was brought up with both of her parents disregarding mental health, they always told her not to feel the way she did as so many people have it worse off than her. NAME felt she couldn't be honest with her emotions and shut them away, then feeling guilty for ever feeling anxious or low. NAME has lost 2 friends to suicide, once when she was AGE and once when she was AGE, NAME never felt able to speak to her parents about this. Due to her anxiety and low mood NAME struggled with hope for the future due to never getting support for her mental health. When NAME got an offer for university this helped give her hope and a future to focus on. NAME is living with a chronic illness but the specialists have no idea what it actually is. NAME was told it could potentially be cancer or have long term repercussions like potential infertility. NAME just wants to know what it is and she struggles to live with all the medication and manage the symptoms and uncertainty. NAME had to live with the knowledge of this illness potentially killing her while trying to study for her A levels, decreasing her mental health. NAME and her friend were sleeping together and NAME found he was very hot and cold and emotionally hurting her but she still wanted a relationship with him. He came back from studying in COUNTRY and they spent time together, he then broke up with NAME as he was cheating on her, NAME was extremely upset by this. NAME felt he was the one who blamed her for him cheating and that she deserved the pain he caused her. NAME feels she has always been told the story in her life that she hurts other people. When drunk and after they broke up NAME and her ex-boyfriend slept together at a party, she was sober and he was very drunk but she stated he was initiating the sexual contact. She then found out he had a new girlfriend and he has now said that he believes she has assaulted him as she was sober and he was drunk. NAME believes this was not the case and is anxious about him taking this to the police one day in the future. They do not have any contact anymore. \n",
